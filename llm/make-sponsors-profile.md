I'm Martín Coll @colltoaction.

**About Me**

Hi, I'm Martín Coll 🤖📚, a passionate researcher and developer building innovative tools for programming languages, computer systems, and data analysis. My goal is to create open-source software that makes a positive impact on people's lives.

**What I do**

I work full-time on various projects:

* Building **Widip**, a computing system for YAML-based graph processing, with a focus on ease of use and community engagement.
* Contributing to the **Hypergraph Interchange Format** and other open-source projects related to higher-order network analysis.
* Developing the **MLIR Inet dialect**, an extension of the MLIR core allowing Interaction Nets (1990) support.

**Why I do what I do**

I believe that open-source software is essential for creating a more equitable and accessible digital infrastructure. By contributing to these projects, I aim to:

* Improve the state-of-the-art in programming languages and computer systems.
* Foster a community of researchers and developers who can push boundaries and make impactful contributions.

**Get involved**
Your contribution will help me:

* Develop innovative tools and technologies.
* Pursue research topics that align with my interests and expertise.
* Build a sustainable career path for myself, allowing me to focus on creating positive change.

## I’m currently working on

### HIF: Hypergraph Interchange Format
HIF is a standard for representing higher-order network data, designed to enable seamless data exchange between higher-order network analysis
software packages. A growing number of libraries support this standard including: [HypergraphX](https://github.com/HGX-Team/hypergraphx), [HyperNetX](https://github.com/pnnl/HyperNetX), [XGI](https://github.com/xgi-org/xgi) and [HypergraphAnalysisToolbox](https://github.com/Jpickard1/Hypergraph-Analysis-Toolbox).

I will present HIF at NetSci2025 in the Software and Data for Supporting Network Science satellite.

### MLIR Inet dialect
The MLIR Inet dialect is an addition to the MLIR core allowing one to work with Interaction Nets.

### Widip: Wiring Diagram Processing
Widip is a computing system that uses YAML as an intermediate representation of Hypergraphs. `nx_yaml` supports the round-trip of the standard YAML textual form through NetworkX as the implementation of the internal graph representation.

### Academic writing
I publish plain text sources for academic and related writings. These can be edited to produce new binary artifacts such as PDFs.

## Recent work
### Spanish talks
Intento compartir mis conocimientos en español y mantengo esta playlist actualizada:

### Future work
I want to present Widip to a large audience such as in a conference. I'm preparing a paper and also working towards a robust implementation. I'm building a community that can push this project to the next level.
