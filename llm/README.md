## Overview
This is a directory designed for working in an LLM-based documentation environment. The `Makefile` is designed to streamline documentation processes by automating the task of generating files using an LLM, including complex dependency pipelines with mixed human and generated content.

## Features
- Utilizes the `ollama run` command to leverage the power of a pre-trained LLM for efficient and consistent summarization.
- Can be customized with the `llama3.2` model (version 3.2) as shown in the example.
