# Abstract

## Interaction nets (Lafont, 1990)

Interaction nets are a graphical calculus based on graph rewriting. They are a programming paradigm for deterministic distributed computation recently popularized by the Bend language. We review an Inet dialect prototype that generalizes turing machines, cellular automata, and a number of word or term rewriting systems.

# Objectives

* Domain-specific compiler for combinator runtimes
* Consider potential adoption versus maintenance cost

# Canonicalization

* MLIR has a single canonicalization pass, which iteratively applies the canonicalization patterns of all loaded dialects in a greedy way: https://mlir.llvm.org/docs/Canonicalization. This is perfect for the fully-local graph rewriting approach in Inets.
* It applies patterns until either fixpoint is reached or the maximum number of iterations/rewrites is exhausted.

CHECK: Pattens with expensive running time (i.e. have O(n) complexity) or complicated cost models donâ€™t belong to canonicalization: since the algorithm is executed iteratively until fixed-point we want patterns that execute quickly (in particular their matching phase).

> Interaction and termination, which ensures that all reduction sequences are finite. Interaction nets are confluent "by construction". This is not the case in general for term rewriting systems. Termination however is not guaranteed for arbitrary interaction nets.
