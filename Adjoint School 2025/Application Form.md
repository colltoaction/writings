# Adjoint School 2025 Application Form

https://adjointschool.com/about.html

DEADLINE: Sunday, 1st December, 2024, 23:59 (anywhere on Earth).

## Introduce yourself

> Q: (~250 words) In place of a CV, write a short paragraph about your educational and/or professional background. Please mention your current occupation or position if you have one. This is your opportunity to brag about yourself!

I want to thank the Argentinian People for supporting my education with Free and Public Education policies. I attended preparatory at National School of Buenos Aires, one of the most prestigious in Latin America and home of two Nobel laureates. I currently attend University of Buenos Aires where I'm majoring in Computer Science.

Last year I finally became a researcher to focus on topics I care about. As a software engineer I was working with unfit tools, and the gap between my mental models and the industry standards grew over time. I started a pet project on the side but I had little time to study and evolve my ideas. Now I work full time on an ambitious project to develop a coherent computing stack. I'm applying Category Theory to compose systems ranging from physical gates in an FPGA to high-level programs using systems for diagrammatic reasoning.

One such system I'm building is the HIF interchange format for Hypergraph Network Science with Cliff Joslyn and a team of higher-order network library authors including XGI, HyperNetX and HypergraphX. This work builds on our experience to set up a robust framework for collaboration and we expect to present it in NetSci2025 conference.

I attend several seminars including Category Theory, Graph Theory and Quantum Logic and I also learn much from online presentations such as Topos Colloquium and GReTA Seminar. I attended the Quantum Physics and Logic conference (QPL2024) where I met many knowledgeable participants including people from previous Adjoint School editions. I was fortunate to meet Federico Holik and other local students who invited me to join their seminar on Quantum Logic and Computing.

During my Bachelor studies I had four internships in the U.S, one at Google and three at Microsoft. I worked in the Windows Photos application, in the Google Developer portal, and in the open-source .NET Framework Core. I was also a teaching assistant in Algorithms and in Digital Technology courses. Most recently I worked as a senior network engineer at Medallia but since then I've shifted my attention to my Master's studies and academia with the goal of producing knowledge and tools with a lasting impact.

## Describe your expectations for the Adjoint School

> Q: (~250 words) For example: What would you like to get out of this school? How can this school help you in your career or research goals? What aspects of the school appeal most to you?

I hope to meet people whot 

transition from independent to collaboration.

Category Theory has reshaped my mind in the last years since I discovered it. I always had good intuition, pattern recognition and abstract reasoning abilities. Things like math and programming always made sense but I felt like they were lacking powerful mental models I had. Category Theory has given me these and many more tools that deeply influenced how I think. I hope to meet like-minded people who seek a unifying substrate for thought and communication.

I'm excited for the opportunity to have expert mentors in fields such as Quantum Logic and Computing as well as Category Theory. I wish to work hand in hand, learning from them and talented peers. I wish to participate in lively debates and actively challenge my assumptions. I want to share my crazy ideas out loud and hear everyone's thoughts.

I'm convinced Adjoint School 2025 will continue pushing the boundaries of knowledge and I want to be part of this group. This exposure would have a long-lasting impact in my academic opportunities. I hope the School would give me a large network I can continue working with in this line of research.

Remote participation is a unique opportunity for me to join a long-term school with people from all over the world. I wish to get my peer's attention and foster a local experts hub. I also want to represent Argentina during the on-site conference and demonstrate our scientific capabilities.

## Describe what you think you could contribute to the Adjoint School

> Q: (~250 words) For example: What skills do you have that could be useful in the Adjoint School? Do you have experience in something that could complement other students well? Do you have any particular knowledge that could be interesting?

contribute new tools to the whole science ecosystem with my CS superpowers

In July I attended the Quantum Physics and Logic conference (QPL2024) and met many participants of previous Adjoint School editions. In preparation for this conference I have studied papers and presentations from many ACT authors, especially the GReTA Seminar and Topos Colloquium. My interaction with this community was very positive and I can bring the same collaborative spirit.

I'm developing reversible hardware descriptions for FPGAs where I see gaps in the fully-reversible computer stack, encompassing classical and quantum computing. I currently publish these definitions for the Argentinian Open Industrial Computer board where I run real world tests. I wish to use these abilities and tools to complement the usual theoretical orientation of student groups. I would also like to contribute my special interest in String Diagram Rewrite Theory which I apply to computing systems based on diagrammatic reasoning and programming.

I participate in the open-source ecosystem and I often share my knowledge with the public domain. I'm very active and promote collaboration across projects. As an example I'm currently developing a standard in collaboration with three well known hypergraph analysis libraries. My field experience would be very useful in the larger context of the School.

I love giving technical presentations. I prepare well and speak confidently about the topics I know about. This is so fun to me that I would love to do it for the group.

## Which of the following best describes your approach to applied category theory (ACT)?
I have an applied background and I am interested in category theory.
