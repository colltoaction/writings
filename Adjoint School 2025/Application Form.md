## Introduce yourself

> Q: (~250 words) In place of a CV, write a short paragraph about your educational and/or professional background. Please mention your current occupation or position if you have one. This is your opportunity to brag about yourself!

My passion is for computing in general, and every day I find new ways to get myself involved. I'm a Bachelor from University of Buenos Aires with a minor in Computer Engineering and a major in Computer Science.

For more than ten years, while studying, I had full-time engineering jobs. I traveled to the U.S. for several internships at Google and Microsoft, but I decided to have a professional career in my home city and continue my Master's studies.

Last year I decided to quit and focus on open, free research. I have recently developed open hardware definitions for reversible gates in FPGAs. I'm collaborating with hypergraph library authors in an interchange format that will bridge an existing gap in the scientist toolkit. In July I attended the Quantum Physics and Logic conference (QPL2025) and I'm taking an independent course on the same topic.
