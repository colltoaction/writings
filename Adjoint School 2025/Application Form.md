DEADLINE: Sunday, 1st December, 2024, 23:59 (anywhere on Earth).

## Introduce yourself

> Q: (~250 words) In place of a CV, write a short paragraph about your educational and/or professional background. Please mention your current occupation or position if you have one. This is your opportunity to brag about yourself!

I'm profoundly grateful for the extraordinary opportunities Argentina has given me with Free and Public Education policies. I attended preparatory at National School of Buenos Aires, one of the most prestigious in Latin America and home of two Nobel laureates. I currently attend University of Buenos Aires where I'm majoring in Computer Science.

I worked full-time jobs all my adult life, as most students here do. Early on I started a software engineering career which informs my views on real-life applications of science. As an advanced student I had four internships in the U.S, one at Google and three at Microsoft. When I was offered a permanent position I rejected it to settle in my home city. As I finished my Bachelor studies I moved on to senior roles in a startup and then a big company.

This year has been the most challenging since I decided to quit and become an independent researcher. My goal is to found a science-oriented cooperative where researchers can be part of the traditional economy. I attend several seminars including Category Theory, Graph Theory and Quantum Logic and I also enjoy watching conferences on YouTube. I'm working towards a complete redesign of Computing, from physical gates and FPGAs to programming languages and diagrammatic reasoning.

## Describe your expectations for the Adjoint School

> Q: (~250 words) For example: What would you like to get out of this school? How can this school help you in your career or research goals? What aspects of the school appeal most to you?

I think this school is the best place to learn and develop the coming paradigms in computing. I wish to participate in lively debates with the most knowledgeable people and be an active participant in expanding the frontier of knowledge.

## Describe what you think you could contribute to the Adjoint School

> Q: (~250 words) For example: What skills do you have that could be useful in the Adjoint School? Do you have experience in something that could complement other students well? Do you have any particular knowledge that could be interesting?

In July I attended the Quantum Physics and Logic conference (QPL2024) and met many participants of previous Adjoint School editions. In preparation for this conference I have studied papers and presentations from many ACT authors, especially the GReTA Seminar and Topos Colloquium. My interaction with this community was very positive and I can bring the same collaborative spirit.

I'm developing reversible hardware descriptions for FPGAs where I see gaps in the fully-reversible computer stack, encompassing classical and quantum computing. I currently publish these definitions for the Argentinian Open Industrial Computer board where I run real world tests. I wish to use these abilities and tools to complement the usual theoretical orientation of student groups. I would also like to contribute my special interest in String Diagram Rewrite Theory which I apply to computing systems based on diagrammatic reasoning and programming.

I participate in the open-source ecosystem and I often share my knowledge with the public domain. I'm very active and promote collaboration across projects. As an example I'm currently developing a standard in collaboration with three well known hypergraph analysis libraries. My field experience would be very useful in the larger context of the School.

I love giving technical presentations. I prepare well and speak confidently about the topics I know about. This is so fun to me that I would love to do it for the group.

## Which of the following best describes your approach to applied category theory (ACT)?
I have an applied background and I am interested in category theory.
