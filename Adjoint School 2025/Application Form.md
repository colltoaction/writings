https://adjointschool.com/about.html

DEADLINE: Sunday, 1st December, 2024, 23:59 (anywhere on Earth).

## Introduce yourself

> Q: (~250 words) In place of a CV, write a short paragraph about your educational and/or professional background. Please mention your current occupation or position if you have one. This is your opportunity to brag about yourself!

I want to thank the Argentinian People for supporting my education with Free and Public Education policies. I attended preparatory at National School of Buenos Aires, one of the most prestigious in Latin America and home of two Nobel laureates. I currently attend University of Buenos Aires where I'm majoring in Computer Science.

Last year I finally became a researcher to focus on topics I care about. As a software engineer I was working with unfit tools, and the gap between my mental models and the industry standards grew over time. I started a pet project on the side but I had little time to study and evolve my ideas. Now I work full time on an ambitious project to develop a coherent computing stack. I'm applying Category Theory to compose systems ranging from physical gates in an FPGA to high-level programs using systems for diagrammatic reasoning.

One such system I'm building is the HIF interchange format for Hypergraph Network Science with Cliff Joslyn and a team of higher-order network library authors including XGI, HyperNetX and HypergraphX. This work builds on our experience to set up a robust framework for collaboration and we expect to present it in NetSci2025 conference.

I attend several seminars including Category Theory, Graph Theory and Quantum Logic and I also learn much from online presentations such as Topos Colloquium and GReTA Seminar. I attended the Quantum Physics and Logic conference (QPL2024) where I met many knowledgeable participants including people from previous Adjoint School editions. I was fortunate to meet Federico Holik and other local students who invited me to join their seminar on Quantum Logic and Computing.

During my Bachelor studies I had four internships in the U.S, one at Google and three at Microsoft. I worked in the Windows Photos application, in the Google Developer portal, and in the open-source .NET Framework Core. I was also a teaching assistant in Algorithms and in Digital Technology courses. Most recently I worked as a senior network engineer at Medallia but since then I've shifted my attention to my Master's studies and academia with the goal of producing knowledge and tools with a lasting impact.

## Describe your expectations for the Adjoint School

> Q: (~250 words) For example: What would you like to get out of this school? How can this school help you in your career or research goals? What aspects of the school appeal most to you?

Category Theory has reshaped my mind since I discovered it. I found powerful mental models and many more tools that deeply influenced how I think. I wish to continue developing in this area that I can only imagine will become more prominent in the scientific community. I want to complement my Computer Science education to build the tools that state-of-the-art research and development requires.

I'm excited to have expert mentors in fields such as Quantum and Category Theory that are not part of the curriculum. I wish to work in their research hand in hand, learning from them and my peers in the School. I would like to participate in lively debates and actively challenge my assumptions. I want to share my crazy ideas out loud and hear everyone's thoughts.

I hope the School will give me a valuable network I can work with afterwards. Remote participation is a unique opportunity for me to join a long-term group with people from all over the world. I believe the exposure of an Adjoint School participant has long-lasting impact in their career and it can be a solid foundation for growing in this area. This is key for me to transition from a self-learner and researcher to a productive collaborator.

I will use this opportunity to represent Argentina and demonstrate our scientific capabilities. I wish to transfer my knowledge and foster a local experts hub that can be part of the global Applied Category Theory scene.

## Describe what you think you could contribute to the Adjoint School

> Q: (~250 words) For example: What skills do you have that could be useful in the Adjoint School? Do you have experience in something that could complement other students well? Do you have any particular knowledge that could be interesting?

As a computing enthusiast I complement my studies in Computer Science with self-learning outside of the classroom. In July I attended the Quantum Physics and Logic conference (QPL2024) and met many participants of previous Adjoint School editions. In preparation for this conference I studied papers and presentations from many ACT authors, especially the GReTA Seminar and Topos Colloquium.

I have experience in digital design and have started an open hardware project for FPGAs. I'm studying Classical Reversible Logic to gain expertise in aspects of Quantum Logic that are readily applicable, and I test my designs on the Argentinian Open Industrial Computer physical board.

I'm particularly interested in the relation of String Diagrams and Hypergraphs. I find String Diagrams invaluable for reasoning and Hypergraphs for implementing powerful computing methods. Rewrite theory 

I participate in the open-source ecosystem and I often share my knowledge with the public domain. I love giving technical presentations. I prepare well and speak confidently about the topics I know about. This is so fun to me that I would love to do it for the group.

I wish to use these abilities and tools to complement the usual theoretical orientation of student groups.

I promote collaboration across projects. As an example I'm currently developing a standard in collaboration with three well known hypergraph analysis libraries. My field experience would be very useful in the larger context of the School.

## Which of the following best describes your approach to applied category theory (ACT)?
I have an applied background and I am interested in category theory.
