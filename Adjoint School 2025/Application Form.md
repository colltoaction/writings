# Adjoint School 2025 Application Form

https://adjointschool.com/about.html

DEADLINE: Sunday, 1st December, 2024, 23:59 (anywhere on Earth).

## Introduce yourself

> Q: (~250 words) In place of a CV, write a short paragraph about your educational and/or professional background. Please mention your current occupation or position if you have one. This is your opportunity to brag about yourself!

I want to thank the Argentinian People for supporting me with Free and Public Education policies. I attend University of Buenos Aires where I'm majoring in Computer Science and I attended preparatory at National School of Buenos Aires, one of the most prestigious in Latin America and home of two Nobel laureates. During my Bachelor studies I was an Assistant Professor in Algorithms and in Digital Technology courses. I also had four internships in the U.S, one at Google and three at Microsoft. I worked in the Windows Photos application, in the Google Developer portal, and in the open-source .NET Framework Core.

Most recently I worked as a senior engineer at Medallia where I confirmed the big gap between academia and industry. To improve my tools I started a project on the side but I had little time to study and evolve my ideas. Today I work full-time on an ambitious project to develop a coherent computing system. I'm applying Category Theory ranging from physical gates in an FPGA to high-level diagrammatic programming.

One component is the HIF interchange format for Network Science I'm building with Cliff Joslyn and a team of higher-order network libraries including XGI, HyperNetX and HypergraphX. This work sets up a robust framework for collaboration and we expect to present it in the NetSci2025 conference.

I attend several seminars including Category Theory, Graph Theory and Quantum Logic and I also learn much from online presentations such as Topos Colloquium and GReTA Seminar. I attended the Quantum Physics and Logic conference (QPL2024) where I met many knowledgeable participants including people from previous Adjoint School editions. I was fortunate to meet Federico Holik and other local students who invited me to join their seminar on Quantum Logic and Computing.

## Describe your expectations for the Adjoint School

> Q: (~250 words) For example: What would you like to get out of this school? How can this school help you in your career or research goals? What aspects of the school appeal most to you?

Since I discovered Category Theory I have incorporated powerful mental models that deeply influence how I think. I wish to continue developing in this area that I can only imagine will become more prominent in science and engineering. I want to complement my Computer Science education to build the tools that state-of-the-art research and development requires.

I'm excited to have expert mentors in cutting-edge research that is not yet part of the university curriculum. I wish to work hand in hand, learning from them and my peers in the School. I would like to participate in lively debates and actively challenge my assumptions. I want to tell my crazy ideas out loud and hear everyone's reflections. I hope that I will have insightful thoughts to share as well.

Remote participation is a unique opportunity for me to join a long-term learning seminar with people from all over the world. I believe the exposure of an Adjoint School participant has long-lasting impact in their career and it can be a solid foundation for growing in this area. Creating a peer network is key for me to transition from a self-learner to producing knowledge and tools with lasting impact.

I also wish to represent Argentina both on-line and in-person and highlight our scientific capabilities. I wish to share acquired knowledge and foster a local experts hub that can be part of the global applied category theory scene.

## Describe what you think you could contribute to the Adjoint School

> Q: (~250 words) For example: What skills do you have that could be useful in the Adjoint School? Do you have experience in something that could complement other students well? Do you have any particular knowledge that could be interesting?

As an applied category theory enthusiast I combine my studies in Computer Science with self-learning. I'm a big fan of the Computational Trilogy and the unified view of computing, logic and topology. This perspective helps me understand the different backgrounds students bring to the School. I'm particularly interested in String Diagrams and Hypergraph Rewrite theory for categorical computing.

I have experience in digital design and have started an open hardware project for FPGAs. I'm studying Classical Reversible Logic to gain expertise in aspects of Quantum Logic that are readily applicable, and I test my designs on the Argentinian Open Industrial Computer. This effort can be applied to developing low-energy simulators and understanding key aspects of Quantum Advantage propositions.

I value community building and I can be helpful in promoting the School's projects with a wider audience as well as motivating the study group with a cheerful attitude. I love giving technical presentations, writing blog posts and discussing in online forums. I have a practical mindset and often contribute code and written material to the public domain.

## Describe your background in category theory.
> (~250 words) Please write about your background in category theory. For example: Are you new to category theory? If you read a book, say which one and what chapters; if you attended a course, say the topics that were covered; if you watched tutorials, say which ones. 

I started learning Category Theory after a Functional Programming course where I was introduced to the topic. I realized I could use this knowledge to improve my day-to-day work and I started researching Free Categories as I was familiar with graphs but quickly I fell in a rabbit hole.

I spend much time reading and watching academic material. I have collected such material in reading lists, playlists and bibliography for my draft papers. I participate in a student group where I presented Diagrammatic Reasoning as seen in Pawel Sobocinski's graphical linear algebra blog. I believe this is the first video published in Spanish language in this area of applied category theory. My most important reference is "String Diagram rewrite theory I" from Bonchi et al.

Some of my favorite tutorials include "Chyp: Composing Hypergraphs, Proving Theorems" by Aleks Kissinger and "DisCoPy demonstration" by Alexis Toumi. Seminars include "Compositional Modeling with Decorated Cospans" by John Baez and "Hypergraph Rewriting and the Wolfram Model" by Jonathan Gorard.

## Describe you interest in applied category theory.
> (~250 words) Have you tried applying category theory to your domain of interest? If so, how and where (a project, a class, a paper)?  If not, talk about your favorite topic in category theory, a connection between category theory and your domain field, or your interest in one of the projects.

I designed a programming language based on John McCarthy's "Recursive functions of symbolic expressions and their computation by machine." This paper introduces the LISP system and inspired me to review the equivalence of String Diagram syntax and computation under the Rewrite Theory of Cospans of Hypergraphs.

I reached out to hypergraph library authors and my offer to collaborate was well received. I was included in their efforts to standardize a higher-order networks file format and I have plans to extend support for categorical structures, e.g hypergraph categories.

## Briefly explain your Top Pick(s)
> (~250 words) Why are they exciting? Why do you want to join? What do you think makes you a good fit for them?

Structuring Quantum Effects with Monads and Arrows is my top pick because I'm most interested in applications of Category Theory to Quantum Computing. I think I can quickly ramp up in the mathematical aspects of this research group and support my peers with my computing experience.
